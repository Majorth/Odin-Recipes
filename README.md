# Odin-Recipes
First HTML Project.
Goal: Build a basic recipe website.
I will utilize skills learned in the following areas: Linux, HTML, Google Search, Odin Project and git/Git Hub.
Solidified a few items: parent directories (../), using git and pushing to Git Hub and using / with file pathways. I also have to use caution with picture downloads. I downloaded a packet with jpegs and thought they would work. I had to go pull the individual jpegs and got them to works. The HTML was easy to use but tedious as you go line to line of text, not the coding yet. :) I enjoyed this task. It brought togher many skills learned so far.
